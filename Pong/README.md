# PONG (Auto Pong)

Two examples of how to write Pong are provided. One is with soundfx and one is without. The Pong example without soundfx is less complicated and easier to understand, start there (237 lines of code).

Generally, when game developers are starting out, they will write simple games to understand the fundamentals of design. One such common game is Pong. The examples of Pong provided are written using static classes, my personal preference of course, but feel free to migrate the code to your own style and abstractions. 

Pong requires drawing squares on screen, basic physics, basic collision detection and resolution, along with managing game state. In the sound fx example, collision sound fx and a musical phrase has been added. 

So, if you're starting out with game dev and need some Pong examples to work from, here they are. Have fun!
